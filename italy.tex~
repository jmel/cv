{\bf{Reasons for Applying to The Vatican Observatory Summer School}}\\

Recently, while writing code to integrate the equations of 
stellar structure, I was 
struck by the predictive power of even a simple stellar model.   
Assuming only an equation of state and a central density, 
my programs calculated masses and radii for
degenerate stars and hinted at Chandrasekhar's remarkable white dwarf
mass limit.  As a result of these exercises and my current classes, I
am inspired to learn more about degenerate matter, 
white dwarf cooling times and possible equations of state for 
neutron stars.\\

The 2001 Vatican Observatory Summer School is the ideal 
place to continue my studies of degenerate stars.
By joining students and teachers from around the world, I will learn about 
different cultures and different ways of approaching science and
research.  In return, I can share my own experiences of doing research in the
U.S., such as the excitement of working through the night with Dr. Saul 
Perlmutter discovering supernova, 
or my most recent research and first refereed publication (December 2000 AJ) 
with Dr. Ata Sarajedini studying the properties of Globular Cluster NGC 4833.\\ 
 
The Vatican Observatory Summer School will offer me the opportunity to
continue developing as a researcher honing the skills necessary to
become a successful Astronomer, and I will bring to the program
my enthusiasm and experience. \\

Thank you for considering my application, and  
I hope to join you in Castel Gandolfo this summer.\\

Sincerely Yours,\\\\\\
